A Newsday study has found that children from poor neighborhoods have fewer oppotunities.</p> <p>The chart below shows that the household income is closely associated with the children's "opportunity score". The less income the neighborhood has, the fewer opportunities the children have.</p> <p>The score is from a <a href="http://www.diversitydatakids.org">study</a> by Brandeis University. The institution compares neighborhood opportunity for children across the United States based on resources and conditions in education, health and environment.</p> <p> For example, neighborhoods with quality early childhood education and schools, safer housing, more parks and playgrounds are labled with higher opportunity scores for children.</p> <p>The <a href="https://datausa.io/profile/geo/nassau-county-ny#about">household income data</a> comes from the Data USA project by MIT and Deloitte. Both data are based on census tracts.</p>  <p style="text-align:center"><img src="chart01.ff4ba7c1.jpg"></p>

 <div class="story-body"> <p>The two maps below show the distributions of income and children's opportunity level in Long Island.</p> <p>Towns like Hempstead not only
have very low annual household income(less than $50,000), but also have the lowest oppotunity level
for children (the bottom 20% nationally).</p> 
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="chart02.5e9fd721.jpg"></p> </div>   <div class="story-body"> <h2>Methodology:</h2> <p><strong>* About The Data:</strong></p> <p>I narrow both the income and Chidren Opportunity Score/Level data to Long Island census tracts. Both of them are measured at the national level so that they are comparable.</p> <p><strong>* How Did I Make The Graphics:</strong></p> <p>I used <strong>Pandas</strong> to build and merge my dataframes. I used <strong>seaborn</strong> to plot the chart. The two maps were created in <strong>Qgis</strong> and then I threw everything in <strong>Adobe illustrator</strong> to make them prettier. I used <strong>sawhorse</strong> to build the whole page.</p> <p><strong>* Limitations About The Project:</strong></p> <p>1. The household income is perhaps one of the underlying indicators of the Children Oppotunity Index itself, so the findings may not be very suprising. In a way, it emphasizes the high correlation between economic status and children's opportunity level.</p> <p>2. For the map, I tried to categorize Long Island income levels into five categories based on <a href="https://statisticalatlas.com/state/New-York/Household-Income">the national standard</a>. However, the "very high", "high" or "low" classification is somewhat subjective.</p> <p>Details of the <a href="https://github.com/mingligraphics/newsday/tree/master/Data%20and%20Codes">data, codes</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mingligraphics/newsday/tree/master/Maps%20and%20Graphics">original graphics</a> are on the project's Github page.</p>
