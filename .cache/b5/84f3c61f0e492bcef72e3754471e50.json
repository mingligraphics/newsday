A Newsday study has found that children from poor neighborhoods have fewer oppotunities.</p>\n  <p>The chart below shows that the household income is closely associated with the children's opportunity score (COS). The less household income of the neighborhood is, the fewer opportunities the children have.</p>\n  <p>The COS is part of a <a href=\"http://www.diversitydatakids.org\">study</a> called The Child Opportunity Index (COI) 2.0 by Brandeis University. The institution compares neighborhood opportunity for children across the United States based on census tracts.</p>\n  <p>The Long Island's <a href=\"https://datausa.io/profile/geo/nassau-county-ny#about\">household income data</a> is based on the Data USA project by MIT and Deloitte.</p>\n  <!-- If you use images, the path is just images/___ -->\n   <p style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"/348111ba1c48a5c6d31b9a2e21a49571.jpg\"></p>\n</div>\n<!-- \n  Charts are exactly the same.\n-->\n\n<div class=\"story-body\">\n  <p>Experts measure opportunities for children based on various indicators, including early childhood education and schools, safe housing, access to healthy food, parks and playgrounds and clean air etc.</p>\n  <p>The two maps below show the distributions of income and children's opportunity level in Long Island. Unfortunately, Long Island children from low income families are less likely to get opportunities to thrive.</p>\n  <p>Towns like Hempstead, Wyandanch or Riverhead not only\nhave the lowest household income level, not also have the fewest oppotunities\nfor children.</p>\n  <!-- If you use images, the path is just images/___ -->\n<p style=\"text-align: center\"><img src=\"/2ccec12424bfe7a00e0f5a0edb4e36f9.jpg\"></p>  \n</div>\n\n\n<!-- \n  If you want to use something exported from ai2html...\n    1.

I used <strong>seaborn</strong> to plot the chart. The two maps were created in <strong>Qgis</strong> and then I threw everything in <strong>Adobe illustrator</strong> to make them prettier. I used <strong>sawhorse</strong> to build the whole page.</p>\n    <p><strong>* Limitation About The Project:</strong></p>\n    <p>The limitation is that the household income is perhaps one of the underlying indicators of the Children Oppotunity Index itself, so the findings may not be very suprising. In a way, it emphasizes the high correlation between economic status and children's opportunity level.</p>\n    <p>All the data and codes are on the project's <a href=\"https://github.com/mingligraphics/newsday\">Github page</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n    <div class=\"footer\">\n        &copy; <a href=\"\"></a> 2020\n    </div>  </main>\n\n  <!-- We'll always keep this JS file around -->\n  <script src=\"/18e4bbb13bdf9038bce185813f82c282.js\"></script>\n\n</body>\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"22471966812c1af435ef06aafbd1618a","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
