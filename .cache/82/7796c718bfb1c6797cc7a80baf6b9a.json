A Newsday study has found that children from poor neighborhoods have fewer oppotunities.</p> <p>The chart below shows that the household income is closely associated with the children's \"opportunity score\". The less income the neighborhood has, the fewer opportunities the children have.</p> <p>The score is from a <a href=\"http://www.diversitydatakids.org\">study</a> by Brandeis University. The institution compares neighborhood opportunity for children across the United States based on resources and conditions in education, health and environment.</p> <p> For example, neighborhoods with quality early childhood education and schools, safer housing, more parks and playgrounds are labled with higher opportunity scores for children.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://datausa.io/profile/geo/nassau-county-ny#about\">household income data</a> comes from the Data USA project by MIT and Deloitte. Both data are based on census tracts.</p>  <p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"348111ba1c48a5c6d31b9a2e21a49571.jpg\"></p>\n</div>\n <div class=\"story-body\"> <p>The two maps below show the distributions of income and children's opportunity level in Long Island.</p> <p>Towns like Hempstead not only\nhave very low annual household income(less than $50,000), but also have the lowest oppotunity level\nfor children (the bottom 20% nationally).</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"2ccec12424bfe7a00e0f5a0edb4e36f9.jpg\"></p> </div>   <div class=\"story-body\"> <h2>Methodology:</h2> <p><strong>* About The Data:</strong></p> <p>I narrow both the income and Chidren Opportunity Score/Level data to Long Island census tracts. Both of them are measured at the national level so that they are comparable.</p> <p><strong>* How Did I Make The Graphics:</strong></p> <p>I used <strong>Pandas</strong> to build and merge my dataframes. I used <strong>seaborn</strong> to plot the chart. The two maps were created in <strong>Qgis</strong> and then I threw everything in <strong>Adobe illustrator</strong> to make them prettier. I used <strong>sawhorse</strong> to build the whole page.</p> <p><strong>* Limitations About The Project:</strong></p> <p>1. The household income is perhaps one of the underlying indicators of the Children Oppotunity Index itself, so the findings may not be very suprising. In a way, it emphasizes the high correlation between economic status and children's opportunity level.</p> <p>2. For the map, I tried to categorize Long Island income levels into five categories based on <a href=\"https://statisticalatlas.com/state/New-York/Household-Income\">the national standard</a>. However, the \"very high\", \"high\" or \"low\" classification is somewhat subjective.</p> <p>Details of the <a href=\"https://github.com/mingligraphics/newsday/tree/master/Data%20and%20Codes\">data, codes</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/mingligraphics/newsday/tree/master/Maps%20and%20Graphics\">original graphics</a> are on the project's Github page.</p>\n</div> <div class=\"footer\"> &copy; <a href=\"\"></a> 2020 </div> </main>  <script src=\"18e4bbb13bdf9038bce185813f82c282.js\"></script> </body></html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"ff52beb966da5f145408a380447466c8","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
